# Shooter Game using sprites

This is first game I have made with Pygame. I followed Tech with Tim (youtube channel) to make this game. Enhancing the game, I fixed some bugs that served as finishing touches. The first bug was that the score would continue to decrement by five whenever the enemy and main character would collide, regardless of whether the enemy was 'alive' or not. Second bug was that the score would increment whenever the enemy was shot at by the main character when the enemy was 'dead'.
