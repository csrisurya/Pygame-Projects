# A Star Pathfinding Visualization

I was able to make this visualization also by following Tech with Tim (youtube channel). In this implemenation of the algorithm, the heuristic function 
utlizes Manhattan Distance. 

I'm currently expanding on this project by including more pathfinding algorithms and heuristic functions.
